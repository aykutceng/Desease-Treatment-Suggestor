It's recommended that everyone diagnosed with HIV starts treatment shortly after being diagnosed to keep in good health and free of symptoms. Treatment for HIV is generally very well tolerated. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets which need to be taken every day. HIV can develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but by taking a combination of different drugs or with support from your doctor in taking your treatment, resistance is less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it's vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
